Let&#39;s say we want to help the mayor to prioritize ideas, so we will lay out the verbatims against the concepts of being &quot;action-oriented&quot; and &quot;forward-looking&quot;.</p><p>You can choose any concepts that you want.</p><p>Necessary imports</p><pre><code class="language-julia hljs">using Downloads, CSV, DataFrames

For example, you might want to identify documents that are &quot;action-oriented&quot; or &quot;pessimistic&quot; or &quot;forward-looking&quot;.</p><p>For these situations, <code>LLMTextAnalysis</code> offers two distinct functions for document analysis: <code>train_concept</code> and <code>train_spectrum</code>. Each serves a different purpose in text analysis:</p><ul><li><strong><code>train_concept</code></strong>: Focuses on analyzing a single, specific concept within documents (eg, &quot;action-oriented&quot;)</li><li><strong><code>train_spectrum</code></strong>: Analyzes documents in the context of two opposing concepts (eg, &quot;optimistic&quot; vs. &quot;pessimistic&quot; or &quot;forward-looking&quot; vs. &quot;backward-looking&quot;)</li></ul><p>The resulting return types are <code>TrainedConcept</code> and <code>TrainedSpectrum</code>, respectively. Both can be used to score documents on the presence of the concept or their position on the spectrum.</p><p>Why do we need <code>train_spectrum</code> and not simply use two <code>TrainedConcepts</code>? It&#39;s because opposite of &quot;forward-looking&quot; can be many things, eg, &quot;short-sighted&quot;, &quot;dwelling in the past&quot;, or simply &quot;not-forward looking&quot;.</p><p><code>train_spectrum</code> allows you to define the opposite concept that you need and score documents on the spectrum between the two.</p><h2 id="Score-Documents-against-a-Concept"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Score-Documents-against-a-Concept">Score Documents against a Concept</a><a id="Score-Documents-against-a-Concept-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Score-Documents-against-a-Concept" title="Permalink"></a></h2><p>Let&#39;s say we want to identify documents that are &quot;action-oriented&quot;.

 &quot;It is so sad to see long time local business disappearing. We loved Austin because it was unique, and used to have the feeling of a small town with the advantages of a big city. Now, it is just another city in Texas with gas stations,  banks and Walgreen&#39;s on every corner of every rd. So sad to see Austin go down that rd!&quot;
 &quot;The cost of living in Austin and the surrounding v areas is 100% absurd. Beyond ridiculous. I would do anything to have the \&quot;old Austin\&quot; back.&quot;
 &quot;Used to be proud of Austin and tour visiting friends around.\nNow it&#39;s just a crowded nasty city.&quot;
 &quot;I WISH I HAD BUS STOP BACK AT LEDESMA AND LOTT. I USED TO RIDE THE BUS TO WORK.&quot;
 &quot;I&#39;m really sad about what Austin has become.  It used to feel like home.  Now, it just feels like a big, impersonal city with not much personality, and a lot of traffic (and high taxes).  The city that I loved is gone, which makes me sad and angry.&quot;</code></pre><h2 id="Summarize-via-Plot"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Summarize-via-Plot">Summarize via Plot</a><a id="Summarize-via-Plot-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Summarize-via-Plot" title="Permalink"></a></h2><p>Let&#39;s interactively explore our results.</p><p>We can use <code>plot</code> to plot the documents along the trained concepts and spectrums (simple scatter plot).

The nearby<br>greenbelt area (Country Club<br>Greenbelt), which should be a<br>community jewel, is instead<br>overrun with homeless<br>encampments, and now, the city<br>and parks officials who<br>formerly worked with our<br>community association to<br>(humanely) remove and clean up<br>homeless encampments say there<br>is nothing they can do, because<br>of the change in city policy.<br>The city is spending tens of<br>millions to build paths from<br>the area to Ladybird Lake;<br>meantime, we can't get the city<br>to remove mountains of trash,<br>dangerous needles, and tent<br>cities from the greenbelt and<br>its paths and waterways.

You<br>should expect the same bad<br>results. I have heard the Mayor<br>say that he wants the city's<br>homeless policies to be a model<br>for other cities, to which I<br>say, \\\"What policies?\\\" The city<br>is building a trivial amount of<br>beds, slowly, and at great<br>cost.
